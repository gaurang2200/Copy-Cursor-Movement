# Copy-Cursor-Movement
**Version 1.0.0**

This program is made in python with a GUI library tkinter and automation library PyAutoGUI.

It allows you to record the cursor like its actions like left clicking, right clicking, movement, etc. and then to play that movement exactly as it is with a little slow motion.

When the record button is pressed it stores the coordinates of the mouse in an Array. And then when the play button is pressed, it moves the mouse to that position with a slower speed as it was.
